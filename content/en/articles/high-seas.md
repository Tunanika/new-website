# How YOU can Win a MacBook as a High School Student

So you are a high school student and you want to earn a MacBook? Well, let me tell you just how you can do that with High Seas!

## What is the High Seas Program?

[High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com) is organized by the Hack Club organization. It is a program that allows high schools students to earn points
just by making projects themselves and logging their hours with the high-seas plugin. The more points (which are called doubloons)
you earn, the more rewards you can get. The rewards include a free MacBook, a raspberry pi, a Bambulab 3d printer and much more.

The program is also in collaboration with Github.

## How to get started?

You can just go to [highseas.hackclub.com](https://highseas.hackclub.com) and proceed from there. It's really simple, you just need to sign up and start logging your hours
following the instructions.
Then, you need to start with building a project. It can be anything you want. Keep in mind that the project needs to be open source,
and that people will vote on your project so make sure that it's easy to demo like a web app or you can make an awesome video about it!

## Is it worth it?

Well if you are a high school student you might have some free time in your hands. And you can use that time to build something cool and earn
free stuff! So I would say it's definitely worth it. You can also learn a lot from building projects and you can even make some friends along the way
from the slack workspace. With that said, don't get me wrong, you won't be earning all the rewards in a couple hours. For example, for a MacBook,
you need 4000 doubloons. Which is between 167 to 833 hours of work according to their website. But there are a lot more smaller rewards that are
reasonably easy to get like a raspberry pi, a mx master 3s mouse, a flipper zero and much more. For example, it only took me
8 hours to get the very cool type c powered soldering iron. So don't get discouraged and be sure to check them out yourself!

One more thing that I should mention is that the deadline is 31 January 2025. But they also did this last year so they may do it again in 2026 in case you already
missed the deadline.

## Conclusion

Well that's it. Now you can build projects and earn free stuff along the way. And those can be anything you want. I actually
logged this whole website as a project so even this blog post might have earned me a few doubloons. So go ahead and start building something cool!
