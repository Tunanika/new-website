# Why Did I Finally Make a Better Portfolio Website?

I have been using the same old one page portfolio website for a long time. And I have been meaning to make a better one for a while but
I never got around to it. But now, I finally published my new portfolio website and you are seeing it right now.

## Here are some pages you can check out:

- [Articles](/writing)
- [Projects](/works)
- [About](/about)
- [Photos](/photos)
- [Contact](/contact)

## How did I make it?

I used NuxtJS in making this website because I am a very big fan of NuxtJS. You can check out all the code about the
website [from my github](https://github.com/tunanika/new-website).
