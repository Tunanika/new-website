# Why Nuxt is great for development?

Almost 2 years ago, I discovered this new vue framework called NuxtJS. I was amazed by the devtools and the ease of use!
Since then, I have been using Nuxt for almost all of the websites I build. Including the one you are reading this blog right now.

# How to get started with Nuxt?

Getting started with Nuxt is super easy. You can just use the Nuxt CLI and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-nuxt-app <project-name>
```

THAT'S IT!
Now you have a nuxt project that you can start working on.
But of course, you want to be able to preview your website, so you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or (my favorite)

```bash
bun run dev
```

I also like bun very much but that's a topic for another blog post.
But nevertheless, now, you can preview your website on `localhost:3000`!

I am trying to keep this blog post relatively short, so I won't go into too much detail about how to use Nuxt.
But if you want to learn more, you can visit the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).

## What makes Nuxt so special?

With it's great DevTools and the endless amount of modules you can install, Nuxt is truly a great framework for developers.
By using the DevTools, you can learn how long it takes for your page to load, you can install modules just by clicking a few buttons, and
you can even view the varibles in REAL TIME! Moreover, you can look at the tailwind colors, use icones and browse them right from your devtools and more.
Here's devtools:

## Conclusion

I absolutely love using Nuxt and I would argue that it's the best Vue framework out there. It's easy to use, has a growing community and it's just fun to work with.
So if you are looking for a new vue framework or just looking for something to build websites with, I would highly recommend NuxtJS.
